# Pioneer3_Robot

created 6/13/2017 - Scott P. Arendt

This folder was created to provide software for other people interested in hacking the pioneer 3 robot.  As the hardware built 
them is aging it makes more sense to replace it with arduino's and Raspberry Pi's.  That is what we plan to do here.
